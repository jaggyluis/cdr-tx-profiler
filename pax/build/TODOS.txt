X include seatconfig if available
X implement loadfactor
X apply other aiplane pax types
X loading csv and/or json files in
X interpolate granularity
X assign gates to output?
X turnaround time for planes with no tt - by plane type
X gate choice needs to be more effective:
	X plane size/area
X implement time frame
X implement filter
X implement better filter
X implement passenger filter
X add gender to profile output
X implement seconds on decimalDayToTime
X implement actual gates if available 
X convert all to code refactor// major overhaul
X add padding to tt

-reevaluate efficient padding based on:
	- % of time landed
	- size of plane
	- fix null

- track down richard to confirm aircraft codes:
	*-* - what is what
	X design reference code
	X arc

X fix aircraft stats

- output statistics in a visual manner in order to baseline/verify
X implement module pattern
X number of passengers output
- handle flights with missing/broken data instead of skipping?
X implement domestic/international?
X research better passenger profiles?

X fix Summary.txt
X implement combined tests
- update passenger profiles to include browsing
- allow for profile export
- swap flights to be their own table
