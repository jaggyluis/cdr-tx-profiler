X apply other aiplane pax types
X loading csv and/or json files in

X implement time frame
X implement filter
X implement better filter
X implement passenger filter
X add gender to profile output
X implement seconds on decimalDayToTime
X implement actual gates if available

-reevaluate efficient padding based on:
	- % of time landed
	- size of plane
	- fix null

- track down richard to confirm aircraft codes:
	*-* - what is that
	X design reference code
	X arc

X implement module pattern
X number of passengers output
X implement domestic/international?
X research better passenger profiles?
X fix Summary.txt
