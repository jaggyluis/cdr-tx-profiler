X include seatconfig if available
X implement loadfactor
- implement domestic/international?
X apply other aiplane pax types
X loading csv and/or json files in
- handle flights with missing/broken data instead of skipping?
X interpolate granularity
X assign gates to output?
X turnaround time for planes with no tt - by plane type
X gate choice needs to be more effective:
	X plane size/area

X implement time frame
X implement filter
X implement better filter
X implement passenger filter
X add gender to profile output

X implement seconds on decimalDayToTime
X implement actual gates if avaiable 

X convert all to code refactor// major overhaul
- track down richard to confirm aircraft codes:
	*-* - what is what
	-design reference code
	-arc

- output statistics in a visual manner in order to baseline/verify
X add padding to tt
-reevaluate efficient padding based on:
	- % of time landed
	- size of plane

- implement module pattern
- number of passengers output
